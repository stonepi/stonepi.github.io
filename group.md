## Postdocs

- **Diego Cruces** Feb 2024 -  <br><img src="/images/Diego.jpg" width="300"><br>Diego Cruces got his PhD in the Institute of Cosmos Sciences of the University of Barcelona (ICC-UB) under the supervision of [Cristiano Germani](https://icc.ub.edu/people/379). His main research interest is related with the period of cosmological inflation, he has been working in different mathematical frameworks which aim to describe the inhomogeneities generated during inflation such as cosmological perturbation theory, the $\delta$N formalism or the stochastic approach. Particularly, he is interested in the description of large inhomogeneities (which cannot be described with cosmological perturbation theory) and its phenomenological consequences, such as the formation of primordial black holes, which can be generated once these large fluctuations reenter the horizon after inflation. <br>Diego's publication can be found here on [INSPIRE](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1893636?ui-citation-summary=true).<br>Diego is partly funded by the NSFC Special Grant for Theoretical Physics No. 12447160 (2025) (*Towards a non-perturbative description of cosmological inflation.*).
