# About Me

<img src="https://caihanlin.com/caihanlin.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Shi Pi**.

I am an associate professor in Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research interests are cosmology and gravity, including but not limited to string phenomenology, inflation model building, the generation and evolution of primordial perturbations, reheating, the thermal universe, cosmic microwave background radiation anisotropies, dark energy, as well as the gravitational wave astronomy/cosmology. Here is [[my CV](https://stonepi.github.io/file/CV.pdf)]. 

My publication list is [[here](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1060905#with-citation-summary)]. 




<!--I am a senior student majoring in **Automation** at Fuzhou University and **Robotics** at Maynooth University (Ireland, Combined Degrees). Currently, I am working as a research assistant in the **IACTIP Lab** (Provincial Key), advised by [Prof. Zhezhuang Xu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhezhuang-Xu). Here is [[my CV](https://caihanlin.com/file/CV-HanlinCAI.pdf)].-->
