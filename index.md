Welcome to **Shi Pi**'s homepage. [[中文版本](/file/index-zh/)]

I am a professor in the Institute of Theoretical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ITP-CAS). My research interests are cosmology and gravity, including but not limited to string inflation, inflation model building, the generation and evolution of cosmological perturbations, (p)reheating, cosmic microwave background radiation anisotropies, dark energy, as well as the gravitational wave astronomy/cosmology. I also serve in the editorial board for *JCAP*, *Chinese Physics C*, and *Symmetry*. For details, see [my CV](./pdf/CV.pdf). 

My publication list can be found in [inspirehep](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1060905#with-citation-summary) and [adsabs](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/filter_author_facet_hier_fq_author=AND&filter_author_facet_hier_fq_author=author_facet_hier%3A%221%2FPi%2C%20S%2FPi%2C%20Shi%22&filter_author_facet_hier_fq_author=author_facet_hier%3A%220%2FPi%2C%20S%22&fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_author%7D&fq_author=(author_facet_hier%3A%221%2FPi%2C%20S%2FPi%2C%20Shi%22%20AND%20author_facet_hier%3A%220%2FPi%2C%20S%22)&p_=0&q=%20author%3A%22pi%2C%20shi%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc). For the information of my research group, click [**GROUP**](./group/). Our group meeting will be held in the coffee room of the 3rd floor in the ITP-CAS South Building, from 11 am every Friday. From Sep 2024, our group meeting will be held in CHEP, Peking University, as the ITP-CAS South Building is under repair.

The Gravity and Cosmology (G&C) Group in ITP-CAS also includes [Rong-Gen Cai](http://power.itp.ac.cn/~cairg/), [Zong-Kuan Guo](http://gc.itp.ac.cn/), [Qing-Guo Huang](http://cosmology.itp.ac.cn/), Li Li, [Shao-Jiang Wang](https://wangshaojiang.com), Yong Zhou.

## Research Interest

- **Cosmological perturbation theory**<br>The study of small deviations from homogeneity and isotropy in the early universe, which serve as the seeds for large-scale structure formation and anasotropies on the cosmic microwave background. Nonlinear perturbations, second-order effects, and their observational signatures are my main interests in the recent years. I am also writing a book.
- **Inflation**<br>A rapidly exponential expansion of the universe in its early stages, which provides a paradigm to explain both the large-scale uniformity and small primordial density fluctuations. I enter this field by top-down model building from string theory and supergravity, which was quite a hot topic around 2005. However, as PLANCK does not see much deviation from the simplest single-field canonical inflation, the simple phenomenological models still work. We need more observations to go beyond.
- **Primordial black holes**<br>Black holes that may have formed in the early universe due to the gravitational collapse of large primordial density fluctuations. PBHs are a candidate for dark matter and a potential source of gravitational waves. If so, such GW signals are probable to be detected in the mHz band by the space-borne interferometers LISA/Taiji/TianQin. Stay tuned!
- **Stochastic gravitational wave background**<br>A random and diffuse background of gravitational waves generated by various early-universe processes, such as phase transitions, cosmic strings, and inflationary fluctuations. It is an important scientific goal for many GW detectors. In 2023, pulsar timing array collaborations claimed a strong evidence for a SGWB at $1~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, of which the physical essence is to be confirmed.
